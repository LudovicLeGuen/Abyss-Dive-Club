            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-anchor"></i> exploration</h3>
            <p>Diving is always about exploration. Searching for a wreck, encountering dolphins, beat a personnal depth
                record. You will always explore something new and unlock new knowledge, discover new abilities and push
                new limits. We will help you go deeper in your quest.</p>

        <div class="philosophy-box">
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-people-group"></i> social</h3>
            <p>Fisrt and foremost, our sessions are gatherings. We strongly believe the sea to be an amazing source of
                fun and we love to share it.
                To share is to care and we love to share with other people. Being with others and enjoying the moment is
                priceless. All sessions are closed with a drink at the closest pub. We told you, It's fun to be with us.

        <div class="philosophy-box">
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-fish-fins"></i> ecology</h3>
            <p>Fauna and flora protection is at the heart of every single diver. It is easy to fall in love with the
                deep, but is as easy to protect it.
                This is why we continuously fight for a cleaner sea. We teach our members how to protect the environment
                and we apply strict rules to make sure
                there will be a rich fauna and flora for the next generation.

        <div class="philosophy-box">
            <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-shield-heart"></i> safety</h3>
            <p>Our members safety is paramount. This is why the team is trained and certified to manage a group of
                diver.
                We thoroughly implement safety measures before, during and after each session of each activity to ensure
                minimum risk.
                Diving is fun but we always raise safety awareness amongst the members.
